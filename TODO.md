- [X] create update method and update every gameObject on it
- [X] create rigidbody component to handle physics and gravity for stones or others
- [X] using binary operators for saving extra data in one number

> 1 2 4 8 16 ...
> 19 = 1 + 2 + 16
> 19 & 1 = 1
> 19 & 2 = 2
> 19 & 4 = 0
> 19 & 8 = 0
> 19 & 16 = 16

- [X] using decorator design pattern for creating draggable gameobjects for map builder
- [X] create vector and position model for saving x , y and their distances
- [X] add listener options for listen position properties changing and use it for game objects position changings
- [ ] handle synchronization errors for map pointers

> in map collider checker may while collision is checking an object remove from pointers
